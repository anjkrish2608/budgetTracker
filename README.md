## Description of Application
The Budget Tracker is an application which tracks the users spending, it allows the user to keep track of the overall total and individual entries. Furthermore the user is able to utilise these features offline and the data is still held on the database.

<a id="tech"></a>

## Technologies Used
While creating this application I have used many different technologies listed below:

* JavaScript ES6 : to write all of the code inside index.js
* Node JS : to run the server.js file
* Indexed DB : to maintain the data when the server is offline

<a id="chall"></a>

## Challenges Faced
I actually thoroughly enjoyed this homework. I liked the challenge of nit picking the code to see which variables scope was insufficient and the small syntax errors I made in the beginning in creating the indexed db which drove me crazy. A particular feature I found very interesting was the code used to determine whether the server was online or not I used the code from [Study Tonight](https://www.studytonight.com/post/check-if-user-is-offline-online-in-javascript#:~:text=To%20check%20if%20the%20user%20is%20online%20or%20offline%20when,onLine)%20%7B%20console.), written by iamabhishek shown below.

```
window.addEventListener('online', function(e) {
    console.log('And we\'re back :).');
}, false);
            
window.addEventListener('offline', function(e) {
    console.log('Connection is down.');
}, false);
```
This code does create one error which I will one day fix... the offline variable used to determine whether to complete the post request is undefined unless the server goes offline... I havent yet understood why it doesnt tell you the server is online when the application is initially opened but anyway this creates an error if the user goes offline before posting online.

## Features to be Implemented
In the future I would like to correct the error mentioned in the previous section and refactor the code to be more efficient.
